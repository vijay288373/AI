% Base case: the sum of integers from 1 to 0 is 0.

% Recursive case: sum of integers from 1 to N is N + sum of integers from 1 to N-1.

    N1 is N - 1,
    sum_integers(N1, Sum1),

% Predicate to sum integers from 1 to N and display the result.
sum_and_display(N) :-

% To run the program, you can query like this:
% ?- sum_and_display(N).
